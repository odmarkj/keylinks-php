Keylinks for PHP
===========================================

This PHP library allows Keylinks to be installed on any website running PHP.

## Installation ##

Keylinks can be installed as a composer package.

## Usage ##

For this library to work properly, it needs two things. Access to a fast cache mechanism (file by default). Access to the output of your website just before it is send to the browser. This allows Keylinks to process your website in its complete form.

The Keylinks library works like a filtering function. Which means it can be used to filter a specific view file, a sentence or paragraph, or most commonly your entire website.
